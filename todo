Need MVP:
    I need the data from DOL to be organized with company and the number of jobs they sponsor and I should be able to call the api to get the data.
    Import data to AWS done
    interact with the database through your backend api done
    modeify the sql to get the approprirte infromation
    create the api that calls the database from the sraper.


    - [ ] This is an unchecked task



figure out how to structure the data in dynamodb
currently I will just have a list of jobs with compnay names, 
I do have to filter with sponsorship before putting it in the database though 
I have to make it so that when i recive a job post extract the compnay and put the compnay data, and location data as well


get an api to collect compnay detials 

upload data from 2021 up to 2023 the database
index it with compnay name

Make it fast for multithreading.





The scraper side:

should be robust

Put limits so you don't have to pay!!!

A job collector that runs routinely and saves jobs to the database:

    get the most famous 100 jobs from each state:

    Check if the compnay exists in the sponsering companies table then proceed:

    Must be able to avoid similar jobs :

        Match the compnay first and then the job:
        
         if redundunt see location if same then skip
